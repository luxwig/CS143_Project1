We first built the template and then used the regex to get the expression and used eval() to evaluate the expression. The regex is referred online.

We ran into the problem while dealing with the invalid expression, particularly while detecting divided by zero but is handled now.

There is no major defects in the project but minor defect may occurs which we have not noticed.

As a team we worked together for the project rather than work separately since it is a relatively small-scaled project.
